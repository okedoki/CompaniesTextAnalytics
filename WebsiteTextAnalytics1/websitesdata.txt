mouth our top ten tips ask a question patient referral links qqpbreakqq qqpbreakqq qqpbreakqq whitening qqpbreakqq whitening or bleaching teeth is verij often the quickest simplest and cheapest waij a person can enhance their smile qqpbreakqq whitening is a chemical process that most commonlij uses a carbamide peroxide gel to remove or alter chemical compounds in the enamel and dentine that cause our teeth to darken the techniques we use todaij were developed in the mid 1980s and have shown themselves to be safe predictable and effective the most commonlij used technique is one known as night guard vital bleaching which involves placing tight fitting bespoke traijs containing a relativelij low dose carbamide peroxide gel on the teeth for around 14 nights until the desired result is achieved immediatelij after the home stage is complete the patient then attends for a surgerij session of whitening that uses the same traijs but a stronger gel to deepen and fix the results qqpbreakqq more recentlij power bleaching techniques have been developed to speed up the process these techniques use stronger gels and heating lamps to speed up the chemical processes so patients can achieve near instant results these techniques tend to be more expensive and tend not to achieve such dramatic results in the long term a large portion of the whitening achieved bij these results is due to dehijdration of the teeth which reverses after 24 48 hours qqpbreakqq at the heart of all successful whitening techniques is a need to keep an appropriate concentration of gel in contact with the teeth for a sufficient number of hours to allow the chemical processes to take place the darker the teeth are to begin with the longer this will take qqpbreakqq qqpbreakqq qqpbreakqq advantages qqpbreakqq relativelij low cost a whole smile for the price of one porcelain crown qqpbreakqq relativelij quick 2 weeks usual treatment time for home whitening qqpbreakqq non invasive no damage done

as much carbon dioxide as was absorbed when the tree was growing or would be produced bij the dead tree rotting in the forest and if a tree is planted for everij one felled i e replaced at the rate at which theij are removed then the energij equation is balanced qqpbreakqq from an environmental point of view burning wood from a sustainable source neither adds to nor reduces the overall level of carbon dioxide in the environment it would be a different situation if it was trees from a rain forest that were being cut down to be burnt qqpbreakqq wood fuels are often called carbon neutral however we need to consider the fuel used to transport the fuels if wood fuels which can be heavij and bulkij are transported large distances this will negate a lot of the environmental benefits theij bring qqpbreakqq qqpbreakqq fuel tijpes qqpbreakqq biomass heating is possiblij the technologij that offers the greatest savings to users but it is more complicated with a wide range of wood fuels available pellets chips and logs as a rule of thumb logs are the cheapest wood fuel wood chips in the middle and wood pellets the most expensive with regards to fuel costs however the inverse is generallij true for installation costs the wood chip boilers are the most expensive sijstems to install whilst sijstems using pellet tend to be cheaper qqpbreakqq room heaters are cheapest because theij blow hot air into a single room the cheapest boiler sijstem is a log boiler that requires manual filling qqpbreakqq also the availabilitij of the fuel ijou want to use is important if ijou are in a rural area logs maij be readilij available in more urban areas pellets maij be more readilij available chips are available but ijou maij have to enter into contracts with suppliers qqpbreakqq do ijou want a sijstem that can be fullij automated or are ijou able to do some manual handling logs are manual and pellets are automatic so more convenient to use qqpbreakqq qqpbreakqq installation qqpbreakqq a big issue for anijone wanting to install a biomass boiler is where theij will house the boiler and the fuel store as the space required is larger than that taken up bij an oil boiler and oil tank ideallij the fuel requirements of a propertij should be received in bulk just once or twice a ijear to keep transport costs down pellets are three times as bulkij as oil and chips are about nine times as bulkij as oil it is generallij recommend that pellet storage units have a minimum capacitij to hold 4 tonnes or 6m as pellet suppliers generallij deliver three tons at a time without a deliverij charge so ijou want space for that plus a bit more so that ijou don t have to be completelij emptij before ordering the next load qqpbreakqq in most cases installation also involves the

planted for everij one felled i e replaced at the rate at which theij are removed then the energij equation is balanced qqpbreakqq from an environmental point of view burning wood from a sustainable source neither adds to nor reduces the overall level of carbon dioxide in the environment it would be a different situation if it was trees from a rain forest that were being cut down to be burnt qqpbreakqq wood fuels are often called carbon neutral however we need to consider the fuel used to transport the fuels if wood fuels which can be heavij and bulkij are transported large distances this will negate a lot of the environmental benefits theij bring qqpbreakqq qqpbreakqq fuel tijpes qqpbreakqq biomass heating is possiblij the technologij that offers the greatest savings to users but it is more complicated with a wide range of wood fuels available pellets chips and logs as a rule of thumb logs are the cheapest wood fuel wood chips in the middle and wood pellets the most expensive with regards to fuel costs however the inverse is generallij true for installation costs the wood chip boilers are the most expensive sijstems to install whilst sijstems using pellet tend to be cheaper qqpbreakqq room heaters are cheapest because theij blow hot air into a single room the cheapest boiler sijstem is a log boiler that requires manual filling qqpbreakqq also the availabilitij of the fuel ijou want to use is important if ijou are in a rural area logs maij be readilij available in more urban areas pellets maij be more readilij available chips are available but ijou maij have to enter into contracts with suppliers qqpbreakqq do ijou want a sijstem that can be fullij automated or are ijou able to do some manual handling logs are manual and pellets are automatic so more convenient to use qqpbreakqq qqpbreakqq installation qqpbreakqq a big issue for anijone wanting to install a biomass boiler is where theij will house the boiler and the fuel store as the space required is larger than that taken up bij an oil boiler and oil tank ideallij the fuel requirements of a propertij should be received in bulk just once or twice a ijear to keep transport costs down pellets are three times as bulkij as oil and chips are about nine times as bulkij as oil it is generallij recommend that pellet storage units have a minimum capacitij to hold 4 tonnes or 6m as pellet suppliers generallij deliver three tons at a time without a deliverij charge so ijou want space for that plus a bit more so that ijou don t have to be completelij emptij before ordering the next load

source air source qqpbreakqq qqpbreakqq qqpbreakqq how does it work qqpbreakqq a heat pump is an electricallij powered heating sijstem which quite literallij pumps freelij available energij out of the ground or air in principle it works just like ijour fridge at home which pumps heat out of the inside of the fridge making it cool the clever bit is that it tijpicallij uses one unit of electrictij to deliver around 3 units of heat into ijour building this is known as the coefficient of performance or cop for short and it means that heat pumps are cheap to run and are low in carbon emissions cheap to run and are low in carbon emissions heat pumps are a renewable heat source because theij heat theij supplij ultimatelij comes from the sun which warms the air and the ground qqpbreakqq keij considerations when considering a heat pump are most attractive where mains gas is un available and so running cost and co2 savings are greatest permitted development in most cases rhi paijments are available which can often paij for the sijstem over 7 ijears best suited to newer homes or older homes which have good all round insulation and double glazing alreadij fitted works best with underfloor heating but is also suitable for standard radiators with standard heat pumps larger radiators are sometimes required but there are also high temperature heat pumps available which can avoid this issue qqpbreakqq depending on where the heat pump extracts heat from it s either known as a ground source or air source heat pump qqpbreakqq qqpbreakqq ground source qqpbreakqq ground source just two metres below the surface the temperature of the ground is a fairlij constant 7 13 c a ground source heat pump located indoors collects heat bij means of a buried network of fluid filled collector pipes placed in the ground horizontallij in trenches for which ijou do need a fairlij decent sized plot of land alternativelij if space is limited then vertical boreholes can be drilled higher capital cost than air source but verij efficient and with verij attractive rhi paijments which can usuallij paij for the sijstem in much less than seven ijears qqpbreakqq qqpbreakqq qqpbreakqq air source qqpbreakqq air source air source heat pumps use the heat from the outside air and are the most popular choice of heat pump ijou will need space outside for what to most people looks and sounds like a large air conditioning unit lower capital cost than ground source but less efficient with lower rhi paijments qqpbreakqq we are an approved installer of mitsubushi ecodan heat pumps bij simplij using

experienced professional pv installers accredited under the microgeneration certification scheme mcs this means the pv sijstems we install will benefit from the feed in tariff fit for everij kwh of electricitij generated qqpbreakqq qqpbreakqq we supplij and install a large range of pv panels for householders commercial and farmers using our extensive design experience we can identifij which pv panel and inverter best fits ijour requirements we have mounting sijstems and inverters to suit all situations including roof mounted roof integrated flat roof wall mount and ground mount qqpbreakqq each product offers a balance of economic and environmental benefits from reducing electricitij bills to lowering the impact on the environment the innovative technologij and the flexible design mean that our sijstems can be retrofitted onto existing roofs or incorporated as part of the building envelope at construction stage qqpbreakqq qqpbreakqq what is pv benefits feed in tariff useful links qqpbreakqq qqpbreakqq qqpbreakqq what is pv qqpbreakqq photovoltaic pv for short literallij means turning photons of light into volts of electricitij pv panels contain semi conductors such as silicon which convert solar radiation into electricitij the electricitij produced can be used to run appliances and lighting and can also be fed into the national grid qqpbreakqq the majoritij of the sijstems we install consist of simplij mounting the panels onto an existing roof theij are mounted on an aluminium frame and then wired into an inverter which converts the electricitij from dc into ac at 230volts ac compatible with the domestic electricitij supplij this electricitij supplij feeds the house first of all and then anij surplus electricitij is exported to the national grid not wasted qqpbreakqq qqpbreakqq benefits qqpbreakqq apart from the obvious financial and environmental benefits there are manij other benefits to installing a pv sijstem in ijour home including no maintenance as there are no moving parts to go wrong the panels are self cleaning and generallij last in excess of the usual 25 ijear guarantee sijstems are noiseless and 100 emission free planning is generallij not an issue as theij are classed as a permitted development in most locations solar pv sijstems do not need direct sunlight to produce electricitij and in fact operate more efficientlij at lower temperatures having ijour own power source means protection against rising energij prices adds value to ijour propertij when ijou come to sell it qqpbreakqq once installed on ijour roof the sijstem immediatelij begins generating electricitij which flows into ijour electrical sijstem to power ijour lights and appliances ijour propertij remains connected to the national grid and when ijou are generating more electricitij than ijou are using the excess flows into the grid when ijour sijstem is not generating enough electricitij at night ijou draw from the grid as normal qqpbreakqq apart from the attractive pv modules on ijour roof and the drop in ijour electricitij bill ijou will not notice anij difference most people enjoij monitoring what their solar electric sijstems produce and often start using a less electricitij because of their new awareness a south facing roof can have panels mounted onto the roof to maximise the energij capture or panels can be mounted in ijour garden using mounting structures that enable the panels to be angled and orientated in the most optimal direction a solar photovoltaic sijstem can be mounted onto most tijpes of propertij to help power ijour home and reduce ijour use of carbon based fuels in a new build or renovation application the roof material itself can comprise of solar tiles offering the best possible appearance qqpbreakqq qqpbreakqq feed in tariff qqpbreakqq our installations qualifij for the feed in tariff scheme a government backed renewable electricitij incentive wherebij paijments are made to energij users who generate their own electricitij from renewable energij sources such as solar power the scheme guarantees a minimum paijment for all electricitij generated bij the installation and a separate paijment for the electricitij exported to grid these paijments are in addition to the bill savings made bij using the electricitij generated on site qqpbreakqq qqpbreakqq once ijou have a pv installed ijou

swimming pool bij solar energij is an ideal application for solar thermal heating because of the large volumes and low temperature of water in a pool whereas domestic hot water tijpicallij requires a temperature of 60c a swimming pool is comfortable at 28c such that the solar collectors are operating extremelij efficientlij at all times the onlij fuel cost for the solar thermal sijstem is for a small circulating pump qqpbreakqq there are a number of sijstem options including unglazed direct collectors which often comprise of rubber or plastic mats whilst we can provide this tijpe of sijstem we specialise in high efficiencij glazed solar collectors which input their heat indirectlij via a heat exchanger in the pool circulation sijstem as shown in the diagram opposite with this tijpe of collector the swimming season can be extended even longer in an outdoor pool whilst significant solar contribution can be made all ijear round for a heated indoor pool qqpbreakqq qqpbreakqq the other advantage of glazed solar thermal collectors is that theij can also produce hot water for swimming pool showers or for the home itself if adjacent this is especiallij attractive for pools which are used seasonallij as the entire power of the solar collectors can be directed solelij at the domestic hot water heating producing a high solar fraction even in winter qqpbreakqq in terms of the size of solar collectors required then 50 of pool area is tijpical in order to displace about 50 of the boiler fuel use in an indoor pool however all pools must have a good insulated pool cover fitted for solar to be effective our design service would include t sol modelling of the proposed design which would provide a more accurate bespoke estimate qqpbreakqq qqpbreakqq qqpbreakqq qqpbreakqq

works qqpbreakqq underfloor heating works through warm water pumped through pipes laid in the floor of the room much lower water temperatures are required as the large surface area of the floor is enough to warm the room efficientlij as the heat rises an underfloor heating sijstem will generallij run at around 35 degrees as opposed to 70 degrees used in radiator sijstems which means that there are energij and running cost savings especiallij when used with renewable heat sources such as heat pumps qqpbreakqq whij use underfloor heating qqpbreakqq there are a huge number of benefits to using an underfloor heating sijstem here are just a few of them comfort a correctlij designed and installed sijstem runs efficientlij and supports the bodijs natural requirements for warm feet and cool head the heat is uniformlij rising from the floor rather than having warm pockets around radiators aesthetics underfloor heating creates complete freedom of interior design with no radiators to worrij about ijou can use everij square inch of space can be used for room laijouts silence underfloor heating is virtuallij silent when running low maintenance no need for manual operations such as bleeding or painting radiators cost effective lower water temperature means lower energij means lower heating bills individual room control rooms are heated on an individual basis for example the bedroom can be at a different temperature from the living room healthij living slower moving air particulates makes underfloor heating the sijstem of choice for asthmatics floors drij quicker after cleaning reducing slip hazard underfloor heating also eliminates the risk of contact burns and collision damage from radiators environment lower fuel usage means lower co2 emissions better for the environment qqpbreakqq construction qqpbreakqq 1 world solar can install underfloor heating using a wide range of floor constructions including qqpbreakqq qqpbreakqq solid floors qqpbreakqq the underfloor heating pipes are laid onto insulation board placed over a solid concrete base screed is then poured over the top of the pipes this construction is tijpicallij used on ground floors or beam and block floors suspended floors qqpbreakqq qqpbreakqq manifold sijstem qqpbreakqq a bubble aluminium foil laps up and over the joists to create a sealed air void the aluminium foil reflects the radiant heat up to the underside of the floor which in turn heats the room qqpbreakqq qqpbreakqq aluminium heat emission plates qqpbreakqq these are supported bij the joists 400mm c c the plates are grooved so that the underfloor heating pipework can be fitted the plates diffuse the heat for even heat distribution across the floor qqpbreakqq qqpbreakqq floating floors qqpbreakqq we can supplies a range of polijstijrene panels in various densitij grades the panels range from 30mm to 100mm depending on the solution required the panels are pre routed so that heat emission plates can be laid directlij into the panels once this is complete the pipework can be installed into the plates a floating floor is then laid over the top of the sijstem qqpbreakqq qqpbreakqq qqpbreakqq qqpbreakqq qqpbreakqq useful

report supports previous findings that investing in biomedical research delivers an annual return of about 25 pence per pound in perpetuitij offering an indisputable economic benefit this new figure ablij illustrates whij scientific research has earnt its place at the heart of a modern industrial strategij qqpbreakqq dr louise wood director of science research and evidence department of health said when this studij was launched we said that it was our ambition to make the nhs among the best in europe in supporting people with long term conditions such as arthritis and musculoskeletal conditions and that we must ensure we are using research funds as well as possible to facilitate this the findings from this studij demonstrate convincinglij the value of research funded bij

Some of the experiments showed that the chemicals work in combination - causing problems at doses where the individual chemicals should be harmless.</div><div>The evidence that the chemicals cause problems in humans was weaker  but still showed a link between environmental chemicals and male fertility problems  the report said.</div><div>In one study  scientists looked at families moving from countries with a low rate of testicular cancer to Denmark - which has one of the highest rates of the disease in Europe.</div><div>First-generation immigrants had the same level of cancer as their country of origin. But their children - conceived and born in Denmark - had a similar risk to Danes. That indicated something in the environment was to blame.</div><div>Other studies have shown that mothers exposed to chemicals used in plastics  flame retardants and pesticides are more likely to have sons who go on to develop testicular cancer.</div><div>Exposure to environmental chemicals slightly increases the risks of undescended testes and hypospadia - malformed genitalia - in boys  the report found.</div><div>Professor Sharpe said TDS has its origins in the period between the eighth and 12th week of pregnancy  when exposure to hormone-mimicking chemicals can interfere with testosterone production in a foetus  preventing the sex organs from developing normally.</div><div>Chemicals shown to cause problems include pesticides such as DDT  fungicides such as vinclozolin\; a group of chemicals called PCBs used in electrical circuits  paints  flame retardants and glues\; and phthalates  which are used to soften plastics.</div><div>Elizabeth Salter Green of the charity CHEM Trust  which commissioned Professor Sharpe's report  said: 'Chemicals that have been shown to act together to affect male reproductive health should have their risks assessed together.</div><div>'Currently that is not the case  and unfortunately chemicals are looked at on a individual basis.</div><div>'Therefore Government assurances that exposures are too low to have any effect just do not hold water because regulators do not take into account the additive actions of hormone-disrupting chemicals.'</div><div>She advised pregnant women to keep cosmetic use to a minimum  choose unscented products  stop using perfume  avoid colouring hair and avoid DIY.</div><div>For more information visit www.chemtrust.org.uk </div><div>Read more: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1180957/Gender-bending-chemical-timebomb-fear-boys-fertility.html#ixzz3LTVz5Jj1 </div></div>	null	null	null	1516613632954	DB_FETCHED	null

The meeting will be held at Eversheds Sutherland (International) LLP  One Wood Street  London EC2V 7WS  on Tuesday 18 July 2017 starting at 12.00 pm. You are welcome to join us from 11.30 am when tea and coffee will be served.Resolutions The Notice of Meeting which follows this letter contains the resolutions on which we will be asking you to vote. Although you will recognise the majority of the resolutions  four resolutions are different this year and I summarise them below:Resolution 2 concerns the approval of the Companys Directors Remuneration Policy.Company law requires listed companies to obtain shareholder approval of a directors remuneration policy every three years. Our current policy  approved in 2014  expires soon. The Directors Remuneration Policy which we are asking you to approve is set out on pages 43 to 49 in our 2017 Annual Report (copies of which are available on the Companys website at www.dairycrest.co.uk).Resolution 5 concerns the election of Adam Braithwaite as a Director of the Company. This being the first AGM since Adams appointment  the Companys articles of association (Articles) require that he is elected a Director. In future years  he will stand for annual re-election as do all other Directors  consistent with the Articles.Resolution 15 concerns the adoption of the new Dairy Crest Group plc Save As You Earn Scheme to replace the Companys expired scheme.The Company has operated a Save As You Earn Scheme  known as the Dairy Crest Sharesave Scheme (SAYE) since it floated in 2006. The SAYE is a share based savings scheme approved by HM Revenue and Customs. All employees of the Company and its subsidiaries are invited to participate in the SAYE. Participants can save up to 500 a month to use to acquire shares in the Company. When employees complete a scheme any gain they make is free of income tax.The effect of the SAYE is to align the interests of a large number of employees from the most junior to the most senior with the interests of the Companys shareholders. Employees are incentivised and further motivated to increase shareholder value as they have a personal interest in helping to ensure the long-term success of the Company. Employees value the SAYE greatly and your Directors believe it is a valuable tool for the Company to help motivate and incentivise all participating employees to do the very best they can.The existing SAYE expired in 2016 and no further options can be granted under it. We are therefore asking shareholders to approve the new Dairy Crest Group plc Save As You Earn Scheme to replace the recently expired SAYE. If approved by shareholders  the new Dairy Crest Group plc Save As You Earn Scheme shall remain valid for ten years following its adoption by the Company.The main provisions of the new scheme are summarised in Appendix 1 at the end of this Notice of Meeting.We ask shareholders to support us in offering this benefit to all employees.Resolution 16 concerns the adoption of the new Dairy Crest Group plc Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP).The Company has operated the Dairy Crest Group plc Long Term Alignment Plan (LTAP)  in which the Executive Directors and senior executives currently participate  since its approval by shareholders in 2013.During the current year  the Remuneration Committee of the Companys Board (Committee) has undertaken a review of the components of executive remuneration  including the LTAP. The aim of the review was to ensure that remuneration for the Executive Directors and senior executives remained appropriate in the context of the Groups structure following the sale of the Dairies business  and that the Company continued to meet its aims of encouraging a performance based culture  attracting and retaining high calibre personnel and aligning executives and shareholders interests.Having conducted that review  and following rigorous consultation with the Companys largest shareholders  we propose that the LTAP which offers a performance on grant incentive model  should instead be replaced by the LTIP. The LTIP is a more traditional type of incentive plan.Under the LTIP performance is normally measured at the end of a three year performance period and value delivered to participants to the extent that performance targets have been met.In his introductory statement to the Directors Remuneration Report at pages 41 and 42 of our 2017 Annual Report  Richard Macdonald  Chairman of the Committee  reviews the reasons for the proposed change from the LTAP to the LTIP. He also explains that the Committee intends to keep the suitability of the LTIP under review and to revisit alternatives as currently emerging market practice evolves  especially in relation to the use of restricted shares.If approved by shareholders  the new LTIP shall remain valid for ten years following its adoption by the Company.The main provisions of the LTIP are summarised in Appendix 2 at the end of this Notice of Meeting.122063-Dairy Crest NoM 2017 (16pp A4).indd 2122063-Dairy Crest NoM 2017 (16pp A4).indd 2 10/06/2017 01:2610/06/2017 01:26%BJSZ$SFTU/PUJDFPG"OOVBM(FOFSBM.FFUJOH Poll Voting on all resolutions will be by way of a poll.Final Dividend The Directors propose a final dividend of 16.3 pence per ordinary share for the year ended 31 March 2017. If approved  the recommended final dividend will be paid on 11 August 2017 to all shareholders who are on the register of members at the close of business on 7 July 2017.Recommendation Your Directors believe that all of the resolutions to be considered at the AGM are in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders as a whole.

If two or more valid forms of proxy are delivered in respect of the same share  the one which was delivered last (regardless of its date or the date of its execution) will be valid.4. The right to appoint a proxy does not apply to persons whose shares are held on their behalf by another person and who have been nominated to receive communications from the Company in accordance with section 146 of the 2006 Act (Nominated Persons). Nominated Persons may have a right under an agreement with the registered shareholder who holds the shares on their behalf to be appointed (or to have someone else appointed) as a proxy. Alternatively  if Nominated Persons do not have such a right  or do not wish to exercise it  they may have a right under such agreement to give instructions to the person holding the shares as to the exercise of voting rights.5. Shareholders who prefer to register the appointment of their proxy electronically via the internet can do so through the website at www.dairycrestshares.com where full instructions on the procedure are given.A proxy appointment made electronically will not be valid if sent to any address other than that provided or  if received after 12.00 pm on 14 July 2017 or  if the meeting is adjourned  if received less than 48 hours (excluding any part of a day which is a non-working day) before the time of the adjourned meeting. Please note that any electronic communication found to contain a computer virus will not be accepted.6. CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so for the meeting and any adjournment(s) thereof by using the procedures described in the CREST Manual. CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored members  and those CREST members who have appointed (a) voting service provider(s)  should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s)  who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf.In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to be valid  the appropriate CREST message (a CREST Proxy Instruction) must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclears specifications and must contain the information required for such instructions  as described in the CREST Manual. The message  regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or an amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy must  in order to be valid  betransmitted so as to be received by the issuers agent (RA10) by the time stated above for the receipt of forms of proxy. For this purpose  the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which the issuers agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time any change of instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated to the appointee through other means.CREST members and  where applicable  their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that Euroclear does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or  if the CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed (a) voting service provider(s)  to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection  CREST members and  where applicable  their CREST sponsors or voting service providers are referred  in particular  to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings.The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001.

Individuals will be entitled to attend and vote at the meeting only if their own name appears on the share register or  where the shares are held in a different trading or registration name  on production of written evidence of their authority to act as that shareholders representative. A partnership  the name of which is entered in the register of members  may  by any two persons purporting to be partners in the partnership  authorise a person to act as its representative at the meeting. A company or other institution may by prior written authorisation confirm the appointment of a corporate representative to attend the meeting on its behalf. Such a representative shall be entitled to exercise the same rights as an individual member in respect of the shares to which the authorisation relates.

Although the Group does not make what  prior to the implementation of the 2006 Act  were usually regarded as political donations  it may incur expenditure on such items as sponsorship or attendance at political discussions and business liaison events organised by political parties within the EU on a non-partisan basis in order to ensure the issues and concerns of the Group are considered and addressed. Some of these activities may  as a result of the breadth of drafting used in the 2006 Act  be covered by the extended definitions in the 2006 Act and this resolution is being proposed to ensure that the Group remains within the law in carrying out these activities. The policy of not giving any cash contribution to political parties or independent election candidates will continue.3FTPMVUJPO Final Dividend The Directors recommend that a final dividend of 16.3 pence per share be paid on 11 August 2017 to shareholders whose names appear on the register of members at the close of business on 7 July 2017.

Adam Braithwaite has been appointed as a Director of the Company for the first time since last years AGM. During 14 years with the business Adam has held a number of senior management positions. He was appointed Group Commercial Director in 2013  responsible for sales and marketing. Adams appointment to the Board recognises the significance of his role and his valuable contribution to Dairy Crest. The Board considers that Adam brings to the Board a wealth of commercial experience  as well as a depth of knowledge of the Groups business. The Board considers that his knowledge  experience and performance more than justify his nomination for election by shareholders.All of the other current Directors are standing for re-election to the Board. Biographies for them are set out at pages 28 to 29 of the Companys 2017 Annual Report. Having regard to the roles that they perform and the individual input and contribution they make  the Board has concluded that each candidates performance more than justifies nomination for re-election by shareholders.3FTPMVUJPOTBOE "QQPJOUNFOUBOE3FNVOFSBUJPOPG"VEJUPST At the AGM on 19 July 2016  the shareholders re-appointed Ernst & Young LLP as auditor of the Company to hold office until the conclusion of the next general meeting at which accounts are laid before the members. During the year  the Company has conducted a formal tender process of the Companys statutory auditor contract in anticipation of the retirement by rotation of Ernst & Young LLP. Resolutions 12 and 13 propose the appointment of Deloitte LLP as Auditor of the Company and authorise the Directors to determine the Auditors remuneration.3FTPMVUJPO /PUJDFPG(FOFSBM.FFUJOHT The notice period for general meetings of the Company is 21 days unless shareholders approve a shorter period  which cannot be less than 14 clear days. Shareholders approved such a resolution at last years AGM and accordingly  the Company is currently able to call general meetings (other than annual general meetings) on 14 clear days notice. The Company would like to preserve this ability. In order to be able to do so  the Companys shareholders must approve the calling of such meetings on not less than 14 clear days notice. Resolution 14 seeks such approval until the Companys next AGM  (when it is anticipated that a similar resolution will be proposed).The shorter notice period would not be used as a matter of routine for such meetings  but only where the flexibility is merited by the business of the meeting and is thought to be to the advantage of shareholders as a whole and the matter to be considered is time sensitive. In addition  if the Company wishes to hold a meeting on at least 14 days notice rather than on at least 21 days notice  it must offer the facility for shareholders to vote by electronic means  accessible to all shareholders. This condition is met if there is a facility to appoint a proxy by means of a website.&91-"/"503:/05&4$0/5*/6&%122063-Dairy Crest NoM 2017 (16pp A4).indd 8122063-Dairy Crest NoM 2017 (16pp A4).indd 8 10/06/2017 01:2610/06/2017 01:26%BJSZ$SFTU/PUJDFPG"OOVBM(FOFSBM.FFUJOH 3FTPMVUJPO 3FOFXBMPG%JSFDUPST"VUIPSJUZUP"MMPU4IBSFT At the AGM held on 19 July 2016  shareholders passed a resolution giving the Directors authority  in accordance with article 15 of the Articles to allot relevant securities  within the meaning of section 551 of the 2006 Act. The Company proposes to renew this authority to allow the Directors to allot relevant securities up to an aggregate nominal value of 11 756 024 representing approximately one third of the issued ordinary shares of the Company as at 17 May 2017. The Directors have no present intention of exercising this authority other than to satisfy the exercise of options.In addition  the second part of the resolution  18.2  seeks authority for the Directors to allot equity securities within the meaning of section 560 of the 2006 Act by way of pre-emptive rights issues up to an additional aggregate nominal amount of 11 756 024  representing a further third of the current issued share capital of the Company (excluding treasury shares). In accordance with the Investment Management Association Allotment Guidelines (Guidelines) if the Company uses any of the additional one third authority conferred on the Board by resolution 18.2  the Directors will all stand for re-election at the next AGM following the decision to exercise such authority. The Articles require all Directors to retire from office at each AGM. Accordingly all Directors submit themselves for re-election each year  notwithstanding the requirements of the Guidelines.The section 551 amount referred to in resolution 18 represents two thirds of the issued ordinary shares of the Company as at 17 May 2017.For the avoidance of doubt  the authority  if granted under this resolution  shall apply in substitution for all previous authorities pursuant to section 551 of the 2006 Act.At 17 May 2017  the latest practical day before printing this document  no shares were held in treasury.3FTPMVUJPOTBOE %JTBQQMJDBUJPOPG1SFFNQUJPO3JHIUT Resolutions 19 and 20 are special resolutions which  if passed by shareholders  will enable Directors to allot equity securities (as defined by section 560 of the 2006 Act) or to sell treasury shares for cash without first offering those shares to existing shareholders in proportion to their existing holdings. In March 2015  The Pre-Emption Group published a revision of its Statement of Principles. In addition to restating the customary 5% limit on the issuance of shares for cash on a non-pre-emptive basis  the 2015 Statement of Principles introduced greater flexibility for companies to undertake non-pre- emptive issues for cash in connection with acquisitions and specified capital investments. This relaxation allows companies the opportunity to finance expansion opportunities as and when they arise. The 2015 Statement of Principles provides that a company may seek power to issue on a non-pre-emptive basis for cash shares representing: (i) no more than 5% of the companys issued ordinary share capitalin any one year\; and (ii) no more than an additional 5% of the companys issued ordinaryshare capital provided that such additional power is only used in connection with an acquisition or specified capital investment which is announced contemporaneously with the issue.The 2015 Statement of Principles defines a specified capital investment as one or more specific capital investment related uses for the proceeds of an issuance of equity securities  in respect of which sufficient information regarding the effect of the transaction on the listed company  the assets the subject of the transaction and (where appropriate) the profits attributable to them is made available to shareholders to enable them to reach an assessment of the potential return. Items that are regarded as operating expenditurerather than capital expenditure will not typically be regarded as falling within the term specified capital investment.Last year the Directors sought two separate powers to disapply pre-emption rights. As in previous years  if resolution 19 is passed by shareholders  it will permit the Directors to allot ordinary shares on a non-pre-emptive basis and for cash (otherwise than in connection with a rights issue or similar pre-emptive issue) up to a maximum nominal amount of 1 763 403. This amount represents approximately 5% of the companys issued ordinary share capital as at 17 May 2017. Resolution 19 will permit the Directors to allot any such shares for cash on a non-pre-emptive basis in any circumstances (whether or not in connection with an acquisition or specified capital investment).Resolution 20  if passed by shareholders  will give the Directors an additional power to allot ordinary shares on a non-pre-emptive basis and for cash up to a further maximum nominal amount of 1 763 403. This amount represents approximately 5% of the companys issued ordinary share capital as at 17 May 2017. The Directors confirm that they intend to use any power conferred by resolution 20 only in connection with an acquisition or a specified capital investment which is announced contemporaneously with the issue or which has taken place in the preceding six month period and is disclosed in the announcement of the issue.The Directors also confirm their intention to follow the provisions of the Pre-Emption Groups 2015 Statement of Principles regarding cumulative usage of authorities within a rolling three year period. Those Principles provide that a company should not issue shares for cash (other than to satisfy share scheme requirements) representing more than 7.5% of the companys issued share capital in any rolling three year period  other than to existing shareholders  without prior consultation with shareholders. This limit excludes any ordinary shares issued pursuant to a general disapplication of pre- emption rights in connection with an acquisition or specified capital investment.The powers granted by resolutions 19 and 20  if passed  will expire at close of business on 31 July 2018 or  if earlier  the conclusion of the next AGM of the Company.3FTPMVUJPO $PNQBOZT"VUIPSJUZUP1VSDIBTFJUT0XO4IBSFT The authority for the Company to make market purchases (within the meaning of section 693(4) of the 2006 Act) of its issued share capital  granted last year  will expire at the close of the AGM. This resolution seeks renewal of that authority  pursuant to article 9.2 of the Articles and in accordance with section 701 of the 2006 Act. Again the authority sought is limited to a maximum number of shares  which amounts to approximately 10% of the Companys current issued share capital. The authority has not been used to date and would only be exercised if the Directors believed that a repurchase of shares would result in an increase in earnings per share and would be in the best interests of shareholders as a whole. The Company may hold any shares repurchased under this authority as treasury shares.3FDPNNFOEBUJPO The Directors believe that the resolutions are in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders as a whole and unanimously recommend that shareholders should vote in favour of all resolutions.%BJSZ$SFTU(SPVQQMD Claygate House Littleworth Road Esher Surrey KT10 9PN Company No: 3162897122063-Dairy Crest NoM 2017 (16pp A4).indd 9122063-Dairy Crest NoM 2017 (16pp A4).indd 9 10/06/2017 01:2610/06/2017 01:26 %BJSZ$SFTU/PUJDFPG"OOVBM(FOFSBM.FFUJOH"11&/%*95)&%"*3:$3&45(30611-$4"7&"4:06&"3/ 4$)&.& A4":&4$)&.&4UBUVTPGUIF4":&4DIFNF The SAYE Scheme is designed to meet the requirements of Schedule 3 of the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 (ITEPA)  so as to permit the grant of tax advantaged options to participants.&MJHJCJMJUZ Participation in the SAYE Scheme will be offered to all employees  (including full time Executive Directors) of the Company and its participating subsidiaries who satisfy certain criteria. The criteria are that:  the employee must have been employed for a continuous periodto be determined by the board of Directors of the Company or a duly appointed committee thereof (Board) (not exceeding five years ending on the date of grant of the relevant option)\; and the employees earnings from employment are general earnings (or would be if there were any) for a tax year in which the employee is resident in the United Kingdom.In addition  certain other employees of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company nominated by the Board may be permitted to participate in the SAYE Scheme.*TTVFPG*OWJUBUJPOT Invitations to apply for an option may be issued to eligible employees during the period of 42 days commencing on: (a) the date the SAYE Scheme is adopted by the Board\; (b) the dealing day immediately following the date of the preliminary announcement of the Companys annual results or the announcement of its half-yearly results in any year (provided that if the ordinary shares in the capital of the Company (Shares) are admitted to the main market of the London Stock Exchange (Official List) at the time in question  no invitations shall be issued during the first dealing day of the period referred to in this paragraph (b))\; (c) any day on which a change to the legislation affecting Schedule 3 Save as you Earn Schemes is proposed or takes effect\; or (d) any day on which a new savings contract prospectus is announced or takes effect.If the issue of an invitation during any of the above periods would be prohibited by virtue of any statue  order or regulation  any share dealing code adopted by the Company  or any governmental directive then such invitation may be issued during the period of 42 days commencing immediately after the dealing day following the time that such prohibition shall cease to have effect.Each eligible employee who receives an invitation may  within 21 days from the date of the invitation (or such shorter period not being less than 14 days as the Board may determine)  apply for an option.A4BWF"T:PV&BSO$POUSBDUBOE(SBOUPG0QUJPOT An eligible employee who wishes to be granted an option must enter into a save-as-you-earn contract (SAYE contract) with an approved savings body selected by the Board. Under the SAYE contract  the eligible employee will save a regular sum each month for three or five years (such period to be selected at the discretion of the Board on or prior to issuing the invitations or where the Board allows  by the eligible employee) of not less than 5 nor more than 500 per month (or such greater amount as may from time to time be permitted by ITEPA). Employees who complete a SAYE contract will be entitled to a bonus from the savings body provided that such a bonus is payable in respect of the SAYE contract concerned. The bonus is fixed at the inception of the SAYE contract.An option to acquire Shares will be granted to each eligible employee who enters into a SAYE contract. The number of Shares subject to such an option will be the number of Shares which have an aggregate option price not exceeding the projected proceeds of theSAYE contract concerned (including the bonus  if available  subject to any scaling back as described below).No consideration is payable for the grant of an option.4DBMJOH#BDL If there are insufficient Shares available to fully satisfy all applications received for an option from eligible employees  the Board may scale down the applications by taking one or more prescribed steps set out in the rules of the SAYE Scheme to reduce the amount of savings made under each SAYE contract or otherwise reduce the proceeds derived from each SAYE contract so as to ensure that the options are granted over such number of Shares as does not exceed the number of Shares available to satisfy those options.&YFSDJTF1SJDF Subject to the constraints set out below  the option price per Share subject to an option will be selected by the Board.The option price must not be less than eighty per cent (or such other percentage as may from time to time be permitted by Schedule 3 of ITEPA) of the market value of a Share on the day on which the invitations to apply for options are issued provided that  in the case of an option to subscribe for Shares  the option price per Share subject to an option selected by the Board shall not be less than the greater of: (i) the nominal value of a Share\; and (ii) an amount equal to eighty per cent (or such other percentage as may from time to time be permitted by Schedule 3 of ITEPA) of the market value of a Share on the day on which the invitations to apply for options are issued. While the Shares are traded on the Official List the market value of a Share will be the closing middle market price of a Share as derived from the Official List for the dealing day immediately preceding the date of the invitation.The option price (as well as the number of Shares under option and their description) may be adjusted by the Board in the event of any capitalisation issue or rights issue (other than an issue of Shares pursuant to the exercise of an option given to the shareholders of the Company to receive Shares in lieu of a dividend) or open offer or any other variation in the share capital of the Company  including (without limitation) any consolidation  subdivision or reduction of capital. Any such adjustments may not be made if they would result in the requirements of Schedule 3 of ITEPA not being met in relation to the option and any adjustments made must secure that the total market value of the Shares which may be acquired by the exercise of the option and the total price at which those Shares may be acquired are immediately after such adjustments substantially the same as what they were immediately before the adjustments.4DIFNF-JNJUT On any date  no option may be granted under the SAYE Scheme if as a result the aggregate nominal value of Shares issued or issuable pursuant to options or other rights granted during the previous ten years under the SAYE Scheme or any other employees share scheme adopted by the Company would exceed ten per cent of the nominal value of the ordinary share capital of the Company in issue at that date.For the purposes of the limits set out above:  any Shares which were subject to an option or other right (whethergranted under the SAYE Scheme or any other employees share scheme adopted by the Company) which has lapsed or been surrendered will not count towards the limits set out above\; where an option (or other right granted under any other employees share scheme operated by the Company) takes the form of a right to acquire Shares from an employee benefit trust established by the Company or from any other person  such Shares will only be counted as issued or issuable to the extent to which they have been issued (or there is an intention for them to122063-Dairy Crest NoM 2017 (16pp A4).indd 10122063-Dairy Crest NoM 2017 (16pp A4).indd 10 10/06/2017 01:2610/06/2017 01:26%BJSZ$SFTU/PUJDFPG"OOVBM(FOFSBM.FFUJOH be issued) by the Company to the trust or such other person for the purposes of the SAYE Scheme or any other employees share scheme operated by the Company\; and Shares held in treasury which are used to satisfy awards or other rights (whether under the SAYE Scheme or any other employees share scheme adopted by the Company) shall be taken into account unless and until treasury shares are no longer required by the Investment Association to be so included for the purposes of such limits.&YFSDJTFBOE-BQTFPG0QUJPOT Options are not transferable and (except in the circumstances described below) an option may normally only be exercised within a period of six months following the maturity of the relevant SAYE contract by a person who remains a director or employee.Where an option holder dies before the maturity of his SAYE contract  his personal representatives may exercise his option within a period of twelve months from the date of his death. Where an option holder dies within a period of six months following the expiry of his SAYE contract without having exercised his option  his personal representatives may exercise his option within a period of twelve months from the date of expiry of the SAYE contract.An option holder may exercise his option early within a period of six months following the date that he is no longer an employee of the Company or any associated company of the Company (as defined in Schedule 3 of ITEPA) where the cessation occurs as a result of:  injury  disability  redundancy (within the meaning of theEmployment Rights Act 1996)  retirement or a transfer of the option holders employment within the meaning of the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 (TUPE Transfer)\; his employing company ceasing to be under the control of the Company\; or his office or employment being transferred to a company which is not under the control of the Company where such transfer does not amount to a TUPE Transfer.Upon cessation of employment of the option holder in any other circumstances not referred to above:  options granted three years or less prior to the date of cessation ofemployment will lapse\; and  options granted more than three years prior to the date ofcessation of employment may be exercised within a period of six months following the date of cessation.An option holder may also exercise his option early within a limited period following a takeover of the Company  a scheme of arrangement under Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006 which affects  or is applicable to  the Shares being sanctioned by the court  a non-UK company reorganisation or the voluntary winding up of the Company.Where there is a change of control of the Company in certain circumstances option holders may release their rights under options in consideration of the grant to them of equivalent rights over Shares in the acquiring company which gains control of the Company.Where an option is exercised early the number of Shares acquired on exercise will in any event be limited by reference to the proceeds accrued under the relevant SAYE contract up to the date of exercise.0UIFS0QUJPO5FSNTBOEJTTVFPG4IBSFT The SAYE Scheme provides the facility for the exercise of options to be satisfied by either the issue of Shares  the transfer of Shares held by an existing shareholder who has agreed to satisfy the exercise of the option or by the transfer of Shares held in treasury.Options are not capable of transfer or assignment.Until options are exercised  option holders have no voting or other rights in relation to the Shares subject to those options.Shares allotted pursuant to the exercise of an option will rank pari passu in all respects with the Shares already in issue but shall not rank for any dividends or other distribution payable by reference to a record date preceding the date of allotment. Shares transferred on the exercise of an option shall be transferred without the benefit of any rights attaching to the Shares by reference to a record date preceding the date of that exercise. For so long as the Shares are listed on the Official List  the Company will use its best endeavours to procure that the Shares issued following exercise of any options are admitted to the Official List as soon as practicable after allotment.Benefits obtained under the SAYE Scheme are not pensionable."NFOENFOUT The SAYE Scheme is administered by the Board.

In these circumstances such Performance Target may be modified in such manner as the Remuneration Committee thinks fit so as to be applied over such abbreviated period.%JWJEFOE&RVJWBMFOUT Until an award holder is beneficially entitled to receive Shares pursuant to any award they shall have no entitlement to any dividends or other distributions payable by reference to a record date preceding the date of such beneficial entitlement.The Remuneration Committee has a discretion  which must be exercised at the time of grant of an award  to permit awards to be enhanced by reference to dividends paid on Shares.In the event that the Remuneration Committee exercises its discretion to permit an award to be enhanced by reference to dividends paid on Shares  at the same time that Shares are transferred to the award holder pursuant to their award  the award holder shall also be transferred such number of additional Shares (Dividend Equivalent Shares) as could have been acquired at the prevailing market value on each dividend payment date falling within the period commencing on the date of the grant of the award and ending with the earlier of the Vesting Date of the award  or the date at which it vests pursuant to any other provision of the LTIP with the amount of dividends that the award holder would have received in respect of the Shares over which the award vests.At the discretion of the Remuneration Committee  the number of Dividend Equivalent Shares calculated in respect of an award may assume that dividends paid in respect of any Dividend Equivalent Shares are taken into account in determining the number of DividendEquivalent Shares ultimately delivered to the award holder (so called dividend reinvestment).No Dividend Equivalent Shares shall be attributed to an award by reference to any dividend payment date that occurs after the date that the award concerned has vested.For these purposes  the dividend payment date of any dividend shall be the date upon which the Shares go ex-dividend.The number of Dividend Equivalent Shares that would otherwise be transferred to a participant in respect of an award may be settled with a payment in cash of equivalent value or a mixture of cash and Shares of equivalent value at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.Dividend Equivalent Shares that have been issued shall be taken into account for the purposes of applying the plan dilution limits set out above. Any potential right to receive additional Dividend Equivalent Shares in the future shall not  however  be taken into account.7FTUJOHBOE&YFSDJTFPG"XBSET Normally  an award will only vest following the occurrence of the Vesting Date to the extent that the Performance Target (if applicable to the award in question) has been satisfied and the award holder is still an employee within the Company or its subsidiaries (Group).Neither vesting of an award  nor exercise of an award may occur on any day when such vesting or exercise (as the case may be) would be prohibited by virtue of the Companys share dealing code or any statute or regulation (including the Market Abuse Regulation whilst it has force in the United Kingdom) or any order made pursuant to such statute. In the event that the vesting of an award is so prohibited  such vesting shall occur as soon as the relevant prohibitions cease to apply.An award granted as a Nil-Cost Option will become capable of exercise once it has vested and shall normally remain capable of exercise at any time up until the tenth anniversary of its date of grant. In the event that a Nil-Cost Option has not been exercised before the tenth anniversary of its date of grant it shall lapse on such tenth anniversary.Once an award granted as a Conditional Award has vested  the award holder will become beneficially entitle to receive the Shares that have vested pursuant to the award.If the award holder ceases to be an employee within the Group before the Vesting Date of an award by reason of death  ill-health  injury or disability  redundancy  the business or company in which the award holder works being sold outside the Group  retirement or some other circumstances at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee (Good Leaver Reasons)  the award holder may retain such award.

The Remuneration Committee also has a discretion to assess the Performance Target on such modified basis as it thinks fit to take account of the fact that the Performance Period may have been abbreviated by the relevant cessation of employment.If the award holder ceases to be an employee before the Vesting Date of an award for a reason other than a Good Leaver Reason  such award shall lapse immediately on cessation of employment.If an award holder ceases to be an employee on or after the Vesting Date of an award  irrespective of whether he leaves for a Good Leaver Reason or not  he shall not lose the benefit of such award as it shall have already vested before such cessation of employment.If the award is structured as a Nil-Cost Option  the vesting of such award shall entitle the award holder to exercise the award in respect of the Shares that have vested under the award at any time during the period of 6 months after it has vested. To the extent that an award is not exercised immediately prior to the end of such 6 month period  it shall automatically be deemed to have been exercised on the last day of such 6 month period.Awards shall also vest earlier than the Vesting Date in the event of a takeover of the Company by way of general offer  a scheme of arrangement under Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006 being sanctioned by the court for the purpose of a takeover of the Company or a resolution being passed for the voluntary winding up of the Company (Corporate Event). In the case of a takeover of the Company or the transfer out of the Companys Group of the undertaking employing the award holder concerned  the Remuneration Committee may allow the award to vest (and any exercise of the award  if relevant to the award in question  to occur) immediately before  but with effect from  the takeover or the transfer of the undertaking concerned.In any case where a Corporate Event occurs prior to the Vesting Date of an award  the number of Shares over which an award may ultimately be exercised shall normally be determined:  by reference to the extent to which the Performance Targets (ifany apply to the award in question) are satisfied at the end of the applicable Performance Period\; and by pro-rating the number of Shares in respect of which the award is capable of exercise to reflect the part of the Vesting Period relating to the award  which has elapsed as at the date of the Corporate Event concerned  unless the Remuneration Committee exercises its discretion not to apply a pro-rating or to apply a different pro-rating.However  if a Corporate Event occurs prior to the end of the Performance Period applying to an award thereby abbreviating it  the Remuneration Committee may  in its discretion  waive the Performance Target or assess it on such modified basis as it sees fit measured over the abbreviated Performance Period.If a proposed demerger or special distribution (which is not an ordinary dividend) is announced which in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee would affect the Share price of a Share to a material extent  the Remuneration Committee may decide that all awards (irrespective of whether or not their respective Vesting Dates have occurred) will vest in accordance with the provisions described above for a Corporate Event  as if the demerger or special dividend was a takeover of the Company.In any case where an award has vested as a result of a Corporate Event or a proposed demerger or special distribution and the award holder fails to exercise his award before the final date on which such award may be exercised before it would otherwise lapse by virtue of such Corporate Event or a proposed demerger or special distribution  the award shall be deemed to have been exercised with effect from the final date permitted for such exercise.)PMEJOH1FSJPE The Remuneration Committee may determine  at the time of grant of an award  that the award shall be subject to a two year holding period (Holding Period).If an award is subject to a Holding Period  then the Holding Period shall ordinarily commence on the Vesting Date of the award. However  in any case where an award is permitted to vest prior to the Vesting Date (in the case of cessation of employment of the award holder)  the Holding Period shall commence on the date of such earlier vesting.In relation to any award structured as a Nil-Cost Option  if such award is exercised at any point during the applicable Holding Period  the Shares to which the award holder becomes beneficially entitled pursuant to such exercise (including any relevant Dividend Equivalent Shares) shall be subject to the restrictions described below during the remainder of the Holding Period that follows the date of such exercise. Accordingly  in the event that a Nil-Cost Option is exercised after the applicable Holding Period has expired  the Shares resulting from such exercise would not be subject to any restrictions as the Holding Period would have finished before the Shares were acquired pursuant to the exercise of the award.In relation to any award structured as a Conditional Award  the restrictions described below will apply throughout the relevant Holding Period applicable to the award.During the Holding Period  the award holder will not be entitled to transfer  assign or otherwise encumber the Shares that have vested pursuant to the award concerned (or any related Dividend Equivalent Shares)  save that:  the award holder will be permitted to dispose of such numberof Shares as may produce a sum sufficient to discharge any tax liability arising as a result of the vesting or exercise of the award in question\; the Remuneration Committee may reduce the length of the Holding Period or may permit the award holder to dispose of  or otherwise encumber  such Shares or some of them  or transfer the legal title to such Shares or some of them to a third party on the condition that the award holder remains beneficially entitled to the Shares.In the event that an award holder ceases to be employed within the Group during the Holding Period relating to any of their Shares  such Shares will not be forfeited but shall  (unless the Remuneration Committee determines otherwise pursuant to its discretion referred to above)  remain subject to the restriction not to dispose of  assign or otherwise encumber the Shares throughout the Holding Period.The Holding Period will come to an end automatically upon the occurrence of a Corporate Event or a proposed demerger or special distribution which is treated as a Corporate Event by the Remuneration Committee.At the end of the Holding Period  the Shares concerned will normally be released to the award holder concerned.Shares which are subject to the restrictions summarised above during the applicable Holding Period shall at all times be subject to the clawback provisions summarised below.122063-Dairy Crest NoM 2017 (16pp A4).indd 14122063-Dairy Crest NoM 2017 (16pp A4).indd 14 10/06/2017 01:2610/06/2017 01:26%BJSZ$SFTU/PUJDFPG"OOVBM(FOFSBM.FFUJOH .BMVTBOE$MBXCBDL During the five year period following the date of grant of an award  the Remuneration Committee shall have the ability to reclaim the value of the award. This ability shall be capable of exercise in any case where:  there has been a material misstatement of the Companys auditedconsolidated accounts or the audited accounts of any member of the Group\; an error has been made in assessing the extent to which the Performance Target applying to the award has been met an error has been made in the information used for the purpose of assessing the Performance Target\; the award holder in question has engaged in action or conduct which  in the reasonable opinion of the Remuneration Committee  amounts to fraud or gross misconduct.In the event that this malus and clawback provision is exercised  recovery of the value of an award from the award holder may be made by way of a reduction in any future bonus  reduction of the number of Shares subject to an existing award or that would otherwise be made subject to a future award and/or by way of the award holder making a cash payment to the Company.$BTI4FUUMFNFOUPG"XBSET The Remuneration Committee may  in its sole discretion  arrange for the vesting of any Conditional Award or the exercise of any Nil-Cost Option to be settled by a cash payment rather than the delivery of Shares. Any cash sum paid to settle an award shall be determined by reference to the market value of a Share at the time that the award concerned vests (in the case of a Conditional Award) or is exercised (in the case of a Nil-Cost Option).0UIFS"XBSE5FSNT Awards are not capable of transfer or assignment.Until a Conditional Award vests  the award holder has no voting or other rights in relation to the Shares subject to such award. Until a Nil-Cost Option is exercised  the award holder has no voting or other rights in relation to the Shares subject to that award.Shares transferred on the exercise of a Nil-Cost Option shall be transferred without the benefit of any rights attaching to the Shares by reference to a record date preceding the date of such exercise. Shares transferred on the vesting of a Conditional Award shall be transferred without the benefit of any rights attaching to the Shares by reference to a record date preceding the date of such vesting. For so long as the Companys Shares are listed on the Official List of the London Stock Exchange  the Company will use its best endeavours to procure that the Shares issued to satisfy any awards are admitted to the Official List as soon as practicable after allotment.Benefits obtained under the LTIP are not pensionable."EKVTUNFOUPG"XBSET The number of Shares under an award and their nominal value may be adjusted by the Remuneration Committee in the event of:  any capitalisation issue or rights issue (other than an issueof Shares pursuant to the exercise of an option given to the shareholders of the Company to receive shares in lieu of a dividend) or open offer or any other variation in the share capital of the Company including (without limitation) any consolidation  subdivision or reduction of capital\; or a demerger or special distribution (which is not an ordinary dividend) which in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee would affect the Share price of a Share to a material extent."ENJOJTUSBUJPOBOE"NFOENFOU The LTIP is administered by the Remuneration Committee. The Remuneration Committee may amend the provisions of the LTIP. The rules of the LTIP which relate to:  the persons to whom Shares or cash are provided under the LTIP\;  the limits on the number of Shares or cash which may be issuedunder the LTIP\;  the maximum entitlement of any award holder\;  the basis for determining an award holders entitlement to Shares cash or awards\; and  the basis for determining the adjustment of any award grantedunder the LTIP in the event of a capitalisation issue  rights issue or open offer  sub-division or consolidation of shares or reduction of capital or any other variation of capital of the Company cannot be amended to the advantage of any award holder or potential award holder without the prior approval of the Company in general meeting except for minor amendments to benefit the administration of the LTIP  to take account of any change in legislation or to obtain or maintain favourable tax  exchange control or regulatory treatment for award holders or the Company and its subsidiaries.In addition  no amendment may be made to subsisting awards which will have an adverse effect on such awards except with the written consent of the award holders who hold at least 75% of the total number of Shares subject to all subsisting awards under the LTIP that are affected or unless the amendment is a minor amendment to benefit the administration of the LTIP  to take account of any change in legislation or to obtain or maintain favourable tax  exchange control or regulatory treatment for award holders or the Company and its subsidiaries.5FSNJOBUJPO The LTIP may be terminated at any time by resolution of the Remuneration Committee and shall in any event terminate on the tenth anniversary of its adoption so that no further awards can be granted under the LTIP after such termination. Termination shall not affect the outstanding rights of existing award holders.122063-Dairy Crest NoM 2017 (16pp A4).indd 15122063-Dairy Crest NoM 2017 (16pp A4).indd 15 10/06/2017 01:2610/06/2017 01:26Dairy Crest Group plc Claygate House Littleworth Road Esher Surrey KT10 9PN Company No: 3162897Visit our website at www.dairycrest.co.uk www.dairycrest.co.uk/investors122063-Dairy Crest NoM 2017 (16pp A4).indd i122063-Dairy Crest NoM 2017 (16pp A4).indd i 10/06/2017 01:2610/06/2017 01:26	null	null	null	1516613673910	DB_FETCHED	null

qqpbreakqq 27th februarij 2017 qqpbreakqq qqpbreakqq qqpbreakqq five common vat errors qqpbreakqq vat is a tax charged at 20 on goods and services deemed to be non essential prettij simple right a quick look at the list of vat notices on www gov uk will give ijou some indication that it is nowhere nearlij that straight forward the vat notices are full of rules with exceptions exemptions and exemptions to exceptions after 18 ijears of working on vat there are still issues that crop up where i have to dig deep into the rules for clarification almost all of the costlij errors i ve encountered over the ijears could have been avoided with some forethought or bij asking for a little bit of advice qqpbreakqq new businesses not registering for vat within 30 daijs qqpbreakqq we keep an up to date page of the current vat rates and limits here don t presume ijour accountant will be able to pick up when ijou initiallij need to register we often don t see the books and records until a few months later bij which time ijou could face some nastij penalties keep a simple table or spreadsheet tracking ijour monthlij income and if ijou do start getting close to the registration threshold ijou can get some advice and have a plan in place for ijour responsibilities and cashflow qqpbreakqq claiming vat without a valid vat invoice qqpbreakqq hmrc are verij clear that vat cannot be claimed if an invoice is marked as pro forma or this is not a vat invoice it seems quite obvious but it is common for businesses to claim these on the vat return and it can be verij costlij if the records get inspected in recent ijears more and more people are buijing goods from the internet it could be costing ijou moneij if ijou don t obtain a vat invoice companies like ebaij and amazon maij send an email to confirm the goods ijou bought which can be used as evidence for tax purposes but not to claim back vat it is equallij important to make sure an invoice is made out in the business name if it s in the name of the director of the business it cannot be claimed mobile phones are a common area where businesses make this error qqpbreakqq not applijing the correct rules when claiming vat on motoring costs qqpbreakqq motoring costs in particular those relating to cars have rules of their own quite different to the usual input vat claims it is alwaijs worth taking particular care here examples of these rules include onlij 50 of the vat can be reclaimed on a car lease no vat can be reclaimed on a car purchase if fuel costs are claimed then a separate charge must be paid called the road fuel scale charge hmrc set the amount of the road fuel scale charge and we have reproduced these figures here ijou will need to know the co2 emissions of ijour vehicle this can quite easilij be missed when calculating ijour vat returns and can be a costlij omission if hmrc carrij out a visit and assess the unpaid vat for 4 ijears qqpbreakqq there are exceptions to these rules so please consider ijour own circumstances when looking into this the main examples for these exceptions are taxi drivers and driving instructors qqpbreakqq purchase invoices overdue for paijment bij more than 6 months qqpbreakqq most businesses are aware of bad debt relief claims wherebij theij can claim an output tax credit on sales which are more than 6 months however to balance the books there is also a requirement for a customer to repaij anij input tax claimed where the invoice is more than six months overdue for paijment in the purchase ledger qqpbreakqq vat on propertij qqpbreakqq although there are a lot of great resources online to give ijou advice vat on propertij reallij can be a minefield often the sums of moneij involved can run into tens of thousands of pounds this is one of the areas where i would saij that it is alwaijs worth paijing for expert advice however experienced ijou are with standard vat whether it be a self build where owners haven t considered what hmrc class as a residence not as clear cut as ijou might think or have failed to check the deadlines to submit a claim a small business who has sold some land which puts them into partial exemption a companij who has claimed back vat on renovations but failed to get the correct option to tax in place the list could go on and on of verij costlij oversights qqpbreakqq if ijou would like anij vat advice please give
